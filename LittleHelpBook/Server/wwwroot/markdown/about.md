We'd like to expand the listings of social services for all of Lane County and your help with this is welcome. And for those with experience working with vulnerable populations, help is needed researching how to improve the ease of navigation and access to services for people-in-need. As a Code for America brigade, this is an opportunity for us to learn and practice qualitative research and draw from our [organization's expertise](https://info.codeforamerica.org/qualitative-research). If you enjoy collaboration and creativity, problem definition and solution-seeking, we'd love to have you on the team.

You can find us in the [proj-little-help-book channel](https://eugenetech.slack.com/archives/CUCKTU612) on the [EugeneTech Slack](http://eugslack.com).

Check out our [README](https://github.com/OpenEugene/little-help-book-web) if you like to code.
